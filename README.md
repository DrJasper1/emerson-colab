# Anon Chat

A simple video chatting website with a room system.

## Features
- Create and join rooms.
- Display names (optional, defaults assigned).
- Room capacity (default 2, host can change up to 10).
- Host controls: kick users, IP ban users.
- Text chat within rooms.
- Optional camera/microphone usage.
- Real-time updates of room list on the homepage.

## Project Structure

- `server.js`: Main Node.js/Express/Socket.IO server logic.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
- `views/`: Contains EJS templates.
  - `index.ejs`: Homepage for creating/joining rooms.
  - `room.ejs`: The actual chat room page.
- `public/`: Contains static assets.
  - `style.css`: CSS styles for the application.
  - `script.js`: Client-side JavaScript for `index.ejs`.
  - `room_script.js`: Client-side JavaScript for `room.ejs` (handles WebRTC, chat, etc.).
- `node_modules/`: Directory where npm installs dependencies (generated by `npm install`).

## Setup and Run

1.  **Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:**
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\AM\CascadeProjects\anon_chat
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server (restarts on changes):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    *(Requires `nodemon` to be installed: `npm install -g nodemon` or use `npx nodemon server.js`)*

4.  **Run the production server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Ngrok for Public Access

To share your local server publicly with ngrok (assuming ngrok is installed and configured):

1.  Start your local server (`npm run dev` or `npm start`).
2.  In a new terminal, run:
    ```bash
    ngrok http 3000
    ```
    Ngrok will provide a public URL (e.g., `https://randomstring.ngrok-free.app`).

## Deployment (e.g., to Render)

- Ensure your Node.js version matches the `engines` field in `package.json`.
- Set the start command on Render to `npm start`.
- Environment variables (like `PORT`) will typically be set by the platform.
- For WebRTC to work reliably in deployed environments, you might need a STUN/TURN server. PeerJS's default public servers might work for testing but are not recommended for production.
